# Introduction

### Thank you for looking into helping out!


Following these rules will help save time when submitting pull requests.  In return, we will respect your time by addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping to finalize the pull requests that have been submitted.


RealEstateHelper is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from you.  There are many things that you can do to contribute, from writing tutorials, improving the docs, submitting bugs and writing code.

# Ground Rules
 * Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
 * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.


# Your First Contribution
Should fill this out when we are farther along

# Getting started
For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Be sure to test your changes.
    * Send a pull request.


For something smaller that does not effect the functionality, submitting a pull request with the change is good enough.  Some examples are as follows: 

* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
* Comment clean up
* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
* Adding logging messages or debugging output
* Moving source files from one directory or package to another


# How to report a bug
###If you find a security vulnerability, *DO NOT* open an issue. Email XXXX instead.



### Tell your contributors how to file a bug report.

 When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

 1. What version of RealEstateHelper are you using?
 2. What operating system are you using?
 3. What did you do?
 4. What did you expect to see?
 5. What did you see instead?

# Code review process
The core team will sign off on pull requests and then merge them.  It is your responsibility to make sure that there are no merge conflicts, as well as being rebased onto the current master.  If there is a problem with the pull request then the core team will address it on the pull request and it will be up to you to ask questions for clarification and then update the pull request as needed.
